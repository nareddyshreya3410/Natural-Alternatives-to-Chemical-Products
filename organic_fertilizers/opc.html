	<h1>Pros and Cons of Organic Fertilizers</h1>
	<h2>Pros of Organic Fertilizer</h2>
	<p>A. Boost both nutrient efficiency and organic matter content in the soil</p>
	<p>It improves water movement into the soil and, in time, add structure to the soil. Organics feed beneficial microbes, making the soil more comfortable to work.</p>
	<p>B. Enhanced soil fertility and improved soil texture, drainage, and aeration.</p>
	<p>It can help the soil continuously condition and rejuvenated, thereby improving soil texture, drainage, and aeration.</p>
	<p>C. Enhance the quality attributes of produce as well as yield</p>
	<p>It contains a large number of nutrients needed by plants, which provide relatively smooth and lasting nutrients to plants and have a long aftereffect.</p>
	<p>D. Total Environmentally friendly</p>
	<p>They are renewable, biodegradable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly.</p>
	<p>It does not contain the harmful chemicals that contribute to the pollution and contamination of water and land.</p>
	<h2>Cons of Organic Fertilizer</h2>
	<p>Before nutrients can be released into the soil, microorganisms need to break down the organic components. As organisms need suitable temperature and sufficient water to do their jobs, the effectiveness of organic fertilizers is limited by these factors.</p>
	<p>So organic fertilizers may take much longer to take effect than chemical fertilizers</p>
	<p>But please be patient, when microbial populations re-establish themselves, organic fertilizers will be faster and more efficient.</p>
