	<h1>VITAMINS AND SUPPLEMENTS FOR COVID-19</h1>
	<p>Eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep and exercising daily are important for your overall health and wellness. Now more than ever with the COVID-19 outbreak, we need to find ways to boost our immune system as much as possible.Making sure you are eating a diet high in immune-boosting nutrients is one way you can take an active role in maintaining your health and wellness.</p>
	<p>Your body uses and absorbs nutrients more efficiently when they come from whole food sources like fruits and vegetables, rather than processed foods or supplements. Getting a variety of these foods and nutrients in your diet is essential compared to focusing on just one or two in large quantities. The more colorful your plate is with a variety of choices from the list below, the better.</p>
	<h2>1.     Vitamin C – Citrus Fruits & Greens:</h2><img src="images/1.jpeg" align="right">
	<p>This particular vitamin is a crucial participant in the army of immunity. It helps prevent the common cold. It acts as a powerful antioxidant and protects against damage induced by oxidative stress. For severe infections, including sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), high dose intravenous vitamin C treatment has been shown to significantly improve symptoms in patients.</p>
	<p>Consuming foods high in vitamin C such as grapefruits, oranges, tangerines, sweet red pepper, broccoli, strawberries, kale, and kiwifruit are thought to increase white blood cell production, which is key to fighting infection.</p>
	<h2>2.     Beta-Carotene – Root Vegetables & Greens:</h2><img src="images/2.jpeg" align="left">
	<p>Beta-carotene converts into vitamin A, which is an anti-inflammatory vitamin that can help your antibodies respond to toxins, such as a virus. Carrots, spinach, kale, apricots, sweet potato, squash, and cantaloupe are all great sources of beta-carotene. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, so consuming foods with healthy fats will aid in its absorption. A great immune-boosting combination would be carrots with traditional hummus or a spinach salad with avocado or olive oil in the dressing.</p>
	<p>We need vitamin A for healthy skin and mucus membranes, our immune system, and good eye health and vision. Vitamin A can be sourced from the food we eat, through beta carotene, for example, or in supplement form. The advantage of dietary beta carotene is that the body only converts as much as it needs</p>
	<h2>3.     Vitamin E – Nuts, Seeds & Greens:</h2><img src="images/3.jpeg" align="right">
	<p>Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that is key in regulating and supporting immune system function. Foods rich in vitamin E include nuts, seeds, avocado, and spinach.</p>
	<br><br><br><br><br>
	<h2>4.     Antioxidants – Green Tea:</h2><img src="images/4.jpeg" align="left">
	<p>Green tea is packed with antioxidants that have been shown to enhance immune system function. It also contains amino acids that may aid in the production of germ-fighting compounds in your T-cells, which reduces inflammation in the body and helps fight infection. Green tea can be consumed hot, cold or as matcha powder.</p>
	<br><br><br><br><br>
	<h2>5.     Vitamin D – Sunshine, Fish & Eggs:</h2><img src="images/5.jpeg" align="right">
	<p>The primary function of vitamin D is to help your body maintain optimal blood levels of calcium and phosphorous, which you can get through exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays, or through supplements and the foods you eat.Getting enough vitamin D can also protect you from respiratory infection.  Most people are deficient in Vitamin-D, so it’s best to consult with a doctor about taking a Vitamin D supplement to boost immune response.Vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases the chance of respiratory tract infections,Vitamin D is essential to immune function and helps regulate the body’s immune response. Vitamin D can be found in salmon, canned tuna, egg yolks, and mushrooms. Your body can also synthesize vitamin D with just 13-15 minutes of sunshine three times a week.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>6.     Probiotics, Gut Health & Immunity:</h2><img src="images/6.jpeg" align="left">
	<p>Yogurt, Kombucha, Sauerkraut, Kimchi, Pickles, Tempeh (Fermented Soybeans), and certain types of cheese contain live cultures, also known as probiotics, which are thought to help stimulate the immune system to fight off disease. The microbiome or the “good bacteria” in your digestive system determine how other nutrients and harmful bacteria are processed in your body, making probiotics perhaps one of the most important functions for immunity. The microbiome helps you process the nutrients described throughout the rest of this article, while also acting as an extra barrier for fighting off harmful bacteria and fungi.</p>
	<br><br><br>
	<h2>7.     Garlic – T-Cell Booster:</h2><img src="images/7.jpeg" align="right">
	<p>Garlic contains compounds that help the immune system fight germs in a variety of ways by stimulating cells important to fighting disease and helping to regulate the immune system. It helps boost the production of virus-fighting T-cells and can reduce the amount of stress hormones your body produces which can help keep your immune system functioning at full strength.Garlic is found in almost every cuisine in the world. It adds a little zing to food and it’s a must-have for your health.Early civilizations recognized its value in fighting infections. Garlic may also slow down hardening of the arteries, and there’s weak evidence that it helps lower blood pressure.Garlic’s immune-boosting properties seem to come from a heavy concentration of sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>8.     Vitamin B-6 – Lymphatic System Boost & Red Blood Cells:</h2><img src="images/8.jpeg" align="left">
	<p>Vitamin B-6 is essential in the formation of new and healthy red blood cells, and aids in maintaining the lymphatic system. Chicken, turkey, cold-water fish (salmon and tuna), chickpeas (traditional hummus), bananas, fortified breakfast cereal, and nutritional yeast are great options for consuming vitamin B-6.Be sure to get enough vitamin B as a supplement, as part of your daily diet (you can easily get your daily intake from fortified cereals) or in a multivitamin. </p>
	<br><br><br>
	<h2>9.     Water – Hydration & Immunity:</h2><img src="images/9.jpeg" align="right">
	<p>Water helps produce lymph which carries white blood cells and other immune system cells through the body. There are many foods with high water content such as cucumbers, watermelon, and celery. If you have a hard time drinking plain water, try a cup of green tea with lemon, watermelon, cucumber or mint-infused water for an immune system powerhouse beverage. Think of proper hydration as a way to make it easier for immune-boosting nutrients to get to where they need to go (cells) in your body.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h2>10.   Zinc – Shellfish, Poultry, and Beans:</h2><img src="images/10.jpeg" align="left">
	<p>Popping a zinc throat lozenge, or taking an over-the-counter cold remedy with zinc in it (as a syrup or tablet) helps shorten the length of rhinovirus colds. Zinc also helps symptoms—nasal congestion, nasal drainage, sore throat, and cough—resolve sooner.Zinc has also been found to help produce and activate T-cells (t-lymphocytes), which trigger the body to respond to infections, according to the NIH.For a faster recovery, start taking zinc to treat your illness within the first 24 hours of symptoms. A proper dose of zinc is 75 mg, but beware: Taking more than 150mg per day of zinc could cause zinc toxicity and also have a negative impact on your immune system.Immune system cells need zinc to function as they are intended. Zinc is a mineral that our body does not store or produce. While oysters have the highest food content of zinc, there are several other options such as shellfish (crab, clams, lobster, and mussels), poultry (chicken or turkey), red meat and beans. Zinc is also found in fortified cereals and some breads, but the best absorption comes from animal-based foods.</p>
