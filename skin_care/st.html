	<h1> TYPES OF SKIN AND CHARACTERISTICS</h1>
	<p>Skin type is what you are born with. The four most common skin types are normal, oily, dry and combination.</p>
	<h2>Normal:</h2><p> You're super lucky if you have a normal skin because not only is it the least common skin type but it's the least problematic skin. Normal skin type characteristics:
	<p>* smooth texture</p>
	<p>* healthy glow</p>
	<p>* fine pores</p>
	<p>* no visible blemishes, greasy patches or flaky areas</p>
	<p>* sebum production & moisture content are well-balanced</p>
	<p>* often found in young persons</p>
	<h3>What you should focus on:</h3> <p> Maintain balanced skin. Pure Fiji's Balancing Toner is great for normal skin types. A refreshing toner with passionflower and witch hazel extracts restore balance. Enriched with green coconut water to remineralize, nourish and energize cellular exchange, leaving skin refreshed and revitalized.

	<h2>Oily:</h2> <p> Is shiny and often with enlarged pores. Oily skin characteri</p>
	<p>* easily gets blackheads</p>
	<p>* blemishes or acne can be a constant battle</p>
	<p>* affects younger people</p>
	<h3>What you should focus on:</h3> <p> Deep cleansing, remove build-up of dead skin cells & balancing between excessive oil and maintaining your skin's natural moisture. Pure Fiji's Exfoliating Scrub is a must for oily skincare routine. Refresh and brighten your delicate facial skin with the freshest of tropical ingredients. This gentle and natural scrub eases away impurities and unblocks pores with the power of Pineapple and Papaya enzymes. Then vitamin-rich coconut cr√®me nourishes newly revealed skin for a brighter and younger looking complexion.</p>

	<h2>Dry:</h2><p>  Lack of moisture, flaky, sensitive and even painful at time. Dry skin characteristics:</p>
	<p>* dull, especially on the cheeks and around the eyes</p>
	<p>* lack elasticity</p>
	<p>* visible lines and wrinkles</p>
	<p>* Small pores</p>
	<p>* Tightness or itchiness</p>
	<p>* Common in older women</p>
	<h3>What you should focus on:</h3> <p> keep skin moisturized. Recharge and revitalize dry skin with Pure Fiji's Hydrating Multi Active Serum. Pure dilo leaf and beach almond leaf hydrosol in combination with powerful plant actives, essential nutrients and vitamins naturally supercharge this serum in order to boost hydration and cellular water flow to actively firm, smooth and rejuvenate the skin. Clinical studies show that 3 hours after application, a 21% reduction in wrinkles occurs.</p>

	<h2>Combination:</h2> <p> Combination skin is dry in the cheeks while being oily in the t-zone (nose, forehead, and chin). Pure Fiji's Purifying Cleanser provides that perfect balance for dry and oily areas. This unique cleanser is boosted with papaya extracts to brighten skin tone while passionflower and drift nut extracts restore skin to a healthy balance.</p>
